README.md

This is a project concerned with sound synthesis using a Cortex M4 embedded MCU, specifically the STM32F407 Discovery Kit. We aim to explore oscillators, filters, and eventually advanced synthesis techniques such as Frequency Modulation, Physical Modeling, and beyond. We are using the free GCC toolchain based Atollic TrueSTUDIO for development environment and IDE.
